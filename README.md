## Template

This is a basic Android project template that consists of 5 modules:
- Base
- DI
- App
- Feature
- Test-Core

To use the template:
1. Update the package name in project's build.gradle.
2. Replace "Template" to your project name  
3. Replace "template" in package names.
4. Replace "feature" to your feature name and similarly for the activity and the layout.


The template uses Kotlin and the following libraries:

- Ktx
- AppCompat
- Material Components
- RecyclerView
- Constraint Layout
- AAC ViewModel and Lifecycle
- Dagger
- OkHttp
- LoggingInterceptor
- Retrofit
- Moshi
- Timber
- Findbugs
- JUnitJupiter
- MockitoKotlin
- AssertJ

The template uses Ktlint for formatting and lint checks.
